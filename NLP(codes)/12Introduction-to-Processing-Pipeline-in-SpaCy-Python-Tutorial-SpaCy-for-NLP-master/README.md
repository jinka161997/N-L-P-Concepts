When you call nlp on a text, spaCy first tokenizes the text to produce a Doc object. The Doc is then processed in several different steps â€“ this is also referred to as the processing pipeline.

The pipeline used by the default models consists of a tagger, a parser and an entity recognizer. Each pipeline component returns the processed Doc, which is then passed on to the next component.
